# Quiz Game App

## About the app

This is a simple quiz game app that uses the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). After entering all the requested information on the home page, an fetch request is being made to the Trivia DB to get 10 questions. 
To make the fetch request, [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is being used.
Also, for some components the [Material UI](https://mui.com) tool has been used.
The app is mobile compatible (responsive).
